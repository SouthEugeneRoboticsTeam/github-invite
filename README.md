# GitHub Invite

[![Team 2521][team-img]][team-url]

This easily customizable program will invite users to a GitHub organization who
authenticate with a particular email domain. This was originally created to
automatically invite anyone with a `@4j.lane.edu` email to the South Eugene
Robotics Team GitHub organization.

## Deployment

The backend currently runs on a free Heroku instance, and the frontend runs on
Firebase hosting, though these can easily be substituted for other other hosts
to accomidate your needs.
